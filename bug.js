In Next.js 15, the use of `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` with a complex data fetching process might lead to unexpected behavior or errors if not handled correctly. For instance, if your data fetching involves multiple API calls or external dependencies, a race condition could occur. One call might finish before another, leading to inaccurate or incomplete data being passed to your page component.
